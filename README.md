## Usage

There's not much to see right now.  The main part is activated with `Alt+Shift+Q` on everything but Linux, which is `Cmd+Shift+Q`.  Why Q?  All the keys can be hit with one hand.

## Roadmap

+ Performance Testing with **about:performance*
+ Use arrays to control ports in background scripts, in order ot have multiple connections open simultaneously
