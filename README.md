# kestrel

General browser utilities.

There's not much implemented right now, and what is is somewhat simplistic.  More complicated features are coming.

The extension hasn't been submitted to FireFox addons just yet, but once some of the markers in the roadmap are hit and a lot more commands/features are added, it will be.  Stabilitiy also needs to be improved before I'll submit it.

## How Permissions are Used

### Search

### Tabs

## Usage

There's not much to see right now.  The main part is activated with `Alt+Shift+Q` on everything but Linux, which is `Cmd+Shift+Q`.  Why Q?  All the keys can be hit with one hand.

## Roadmap

+ Performance Testing with **about:performance*
+ Use arrays to control ports in background scripts, in order ot have multiple connections open simultaneously
+ Better folder naming
+ Variables for CSS class names, for future-proofing
+ Fix injection styling inconsistencies
+ Options page and browser storage for settings
